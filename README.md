# SV04-Touchscreen
SV04 Touchscreen Source

Based on the great work of bphillips09 and by inspiration of johncarlson21 & Jyers UI some changes were applied to the classic Sovol SV04 touchscreen:

 - added bed levelling map visualization for 8x8 grid
 - added enable/disable button for auto power-off function (suicide switch that executes g-code command M81 required)
 - added separate power off button
 - preheat buttons labeled "PETG" instead of "ABS"
